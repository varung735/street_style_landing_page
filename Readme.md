# Street Style Landing Page

 - I am VARUN GUPTA.

 - I am currently learning web development 

 - This is my first project in HTML and CSS

## About project 

This is a simple web page with a navbar and a image and some text.

## Concepts Used
    
  1. HTML
     - Learned more about divs.
     - Learned to write HTML in a bit of a planned way rather than coding naively.
    
2. CSS
    - Learned a lot about position property in CSS.
    - Resizing the image
    - Most important of all, learned to build a navbar with `<ul>` and writing appropriate CSS for a suitable navbar.
    
## Time Taken

1. It took me around a complete day to figure out the position property.
2. Making a navbar isn't easy for a beginner. So, It took me an ample amount of time as well.
