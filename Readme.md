# Street Style Landing Page

 -I am VARUN GUPTA.
 -I am currently learning web development 
 -This is my first project in HTML and CSS

 ## Concepts Used
    
    -HTML
        - Learned more about divs.
        - Learned to write HTML in a bit of a planned way rather than coding naively.

    - CSS
        - Learned a lot about position property in CSS.
        - Resizing the image
        - Most important of all, learned to build a navbar with <ul> and writing appropriate CSS for a suitable navbar.
    
## Time Taken

1. It took me around a complete day to figure out the position property.
2. Making a navbar isn't easy for a beginner. So, It took me an ample amount of time as well.
